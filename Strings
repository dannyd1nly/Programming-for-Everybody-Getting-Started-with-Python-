6.5 Write code using find() and string slicing (see section 6.10) to extract the number at the end of the line below. Convert the extracted value to a floating point number and print it out.

text = "X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475"
find_start = (text.find(" "))
find_end = (text.find("5"))
find_result = text[find_start+1:find_end+1]
print(float(find_result))
